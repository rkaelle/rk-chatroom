**INSTALLING NECCESARY PROGRAMS**


Here is my comsci create task

in order to run please install git (to download the repository)

    brew install git


if you do not have homebrew installed you will need to do it here[https://brew.sh/]

in summary you will need to execute the following commands:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    
Since this is a python you should have python 3.9 or newer installed
SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU ALREADY HAVE PYTHON LOCALLY INSTALLED

    brew install python

    

    
    
**INSTALLING**

please execute the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/rkalesalad/rk-chatoom
    
once it is installed locally you can remote into it by executing the command

    cd rk-chatroom

install the neccesary modules and dependencies once in the chatroom folder

    pip install -r requirements.txt
